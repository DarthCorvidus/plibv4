plibv4 - a PHP library

plibv4 stands for „PHP Library, Version 4“. It is partly a rewrite of libraries
I wrote earlier and mostly used in the context of one employer. While all
predecessors were written mostly in my private time and published under GPL, I
want to prevent any legal issues from happening by doing a complete rewrite.
I also see this as an opportunity to improve on my quality, using Unit Tests and
Composer.

plibv4 is a meta project, while the code as such resides within separate git
repositories. So basically this is for meta topics such as this README or to run
all unit tests, while also testing whether all Composer defininitions work
correctly.
At the moment, every plibv4 itself and every plibv4-* repository is constructed
primarily with development in mind, and none of them should be used in
production unless marked otherwise.
